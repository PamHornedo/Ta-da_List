# Ta-da List 📝
## What is Ta-Da list?🧐
Ta-Da list is an interactive web application to-do list that utilizes the css framework 'bootstrap'. Ta-da list gives you the ability to create multiple to-do lists
to track you own and completed tasks across multiple different projects. You can create as many tasks or as many 
lists as you want.

## How does Ta-Da List Work ❓
Ta-Da list consists of a header area and a main area. The main area is a bootstrap row that is made up of two columns. 
The column on the left hand side of the screen contains a card named "My Lists." Inside "My Lists" is a "Create List" button. 


When you click the "Create List" button a new list item is created and appended to the div card "My Lists." 
The "My List" card works as a navigation bar. If you click on one of the lists in this card it will then make
this list active and disaply it in the active list div card. 
The column on the right hand side of the screen contains a card where your active list will be displayed. Inside the active list
card you have the ability to add tasks to your active list. Type a new list item into the text area, then click enter on your
keyboard, or click the "Add Task" button. Then once you have added a task you can click the "Mark as Complete" button or the 
"Delete Task" button.
